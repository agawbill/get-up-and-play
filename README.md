# get-up-and-play
A web app I've been working on in my spare time. 

Essentially, users can create public or private "events"  or "meet ups" centering around physical activity. Looking for a group that wants to play pickup basketball? Search public basketball events that have been created by other users close to your zip code. Cycling? Search cycling events. Tennis? Racquetball?  A group run? You get the idea. For any sport or activity, members can create either public or private events (private events you can send invitations to your friends who are registered on the app) where you select an activity, a location (gym, park, tennis court, bike route, etc.), number of people you're looking to play with,  and you'll be able to link up with other people looking to GetUp&Play!
